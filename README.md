# User Extensions Extension

This extension keeps the list of installed extensions persisted in the user settings file.
This allows you to keep a synchronized environment between your machines by synching the user settings file.

P.S. You can use Github to synchronize the settings file. By making your ~/.config/Code/User/ folder a git repository.
